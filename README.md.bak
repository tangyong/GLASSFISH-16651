GLASSFISH-16651
===============

The repository is for contributing GLASSFISH-16651(http://java.net/jira/browse/GLASSFISH-16651).

Since we support of wrapping of WARs with webbundle: URL scheme, we should explore the option of using it to wrap plain vanilla WARs when such WARs are deployed using --type=osgi property. This will allow OSGi Web Container to be available to a wider audience.

Currently, I have made a prototype of [GLASSFISH-16651] and if using the following way ,  plain vanilla WAR can be wraped WAB(osgi rfc#66) and can be accessed from Brawser. 

Using Way:

1 build fighterfish\module\osgi-javaee-base and osgi-web-container 
Note: because currently, fighterfish project is not integrated in GFv4's main, you must pay attention to some settings in pom files.

2 build main\appserver\extras\osgi-container and main\nucleus\deployment\admin and main\nucleus\deployment\common using my modified files.

3 copy built osgi-javaee-base.jar and osgi-web-container.jar to glassfish3\glassfish\modules\autostart directory

4 copy built deployment-common.jar and deployment-admin.jar and osgi-container.jar to  glassfish3\glassfish\modules  directory

5 setting the value of "glassfish.osgi.start.level.final" into 3 in glassfish3\glassfish\config\osgi.properties file.
